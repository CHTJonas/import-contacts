# import-contacts
Reads contact details from a CSV file and formats them nicely to be imported by the 'Contacts' app on OS X.

Base-project code originally written in Java, then transfered to Python and finally to C++. Development now fully in C++.

All changes/modifications welcome - please be bold!

Using the program
----------------------------------------------

Written primarily for Mac OS X but will work on various Linux distributions.

1)  Open a terminal.
2)  Run 'git clone https://github.com/CHTJonas/import-contacts.git'
3)  Run 'cd import-contacts'
4)  Run 'g++ main.cpp'
5)  Run './a.out'

Done! The program should now be running. You can drag the CSV file you want to read from and the CSV file you want to write to into the terminal windows as an easier way than typing out their full paths.
